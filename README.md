# DDoS-Simulation
Purpose:
The objective of this assignment was to simulate a DDoS attack on a small network, and to
analyze the packet output within the tracer file. I have analyzed my results with a graph and
python script that kept track of sent packets and dropped packets from each user node during
each second of the simulation. Using the given network topology for the assignment I created a
situation where I could maximize degradation with 8 bots.
